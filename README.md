# Function Plotter

A cross platform GUI application built with QT and C++ to plot explicit mathematical functions ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆðŸŒ 

## Run the app

This app is developed using Qt Creator IDE on Arch Linux operating system. It is better to use it to modify and run the app in order to avoid unexpected errors.

You can also run it with CMake command:

```bash
cmake -B build/
make -C build/
./build/src/function-plotter
```

## Tests

I have use [`gtest`](https://github.com/google/googletest) as the testing framework with tests under the directory `tests/`. You can use Qt Creator IDE to easily run the tests and you should see these pleasing greed circles âœ…:

An alternative way to run tests is to use the terminal and `cmake` and `ctest` command like this:

```bash
cmake -S tests/ -B build-tests/
cd build-tests/
make
./function-plotter-test
```
